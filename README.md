# Responsive Login Page UI with Flutter

**This project is a mobile application developed using Dart and Flutter to showcase a user login interface (Login Page UI).**


## About the Project

This project was undertaken to demonstrate the creation of a clean, responsive, and visually appealing login screen suitable for multi-platform use. The main focus is on mastering Flutter's foundational UI components and making the layout adapt dynamically to different screen sizes.

* **Responsive Design:** The layout uses **MediaQuery** to dynamically adjust element sizes (e.g., logo size, padding, button width) based on the device's screen dimensions, ensuring a consistent user experience on various devices.
* **UI Focus:** It serves as a strong starting point for any application requiring user authentication, concentrating solely on the presentation layer.

## Technologies

**Main Language** : **Dart** The primary programming language for Flutter development. 
**Framework** : **Flutter SDK** Used for building natively compiled, multi-platform UIs.

## Key Features

The application presents a user-friendly and aesthetically designed login experience:

* **Responsive Layout:** Dynamic sizing for perfect scaling across different screen heights and widths.
* **SingleChildScrollView:** Implemented to prevent pixel overflow when the soft keyboard is active.
* **Themed Design:** Utilizes a custom color scheme with a prominent **Deep Purple** background.
* **Input Fields:** Contains dedicated `TextField` widgets for "Username" and "Password," including `obscureText: true` for security.
* **Custom Button:** A styled `ElevatedButton` for the login action.
* **Asset Integration:** Displays a local image asset (`image/logo.png`) for branding.
